    <p>
      Thank you for downloading Audovia.&nbsp; We hope you have found it useful.&nbsp; A newer version, Audovia 4.0 (Audovia Classic), is now available from the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/audovia-classic"
	          style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snap Store</a>.&nbsp; It can also be installed by using: sudo snap install audovia-classic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audovia Classic differs from Audovia in that the "home" interface is now used which means that files are read from and written to directories under: ~/Documents/Audovia/.&nbsp; You can migrate your files and database from Audovia to Audovia Classic by copying all the directories in: ~/snap/audovia/current/ to: ~/Documents/Audovia/.
